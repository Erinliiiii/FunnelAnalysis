# FunnelAnalysis
This is a dataset from an e-commerce website. This simple site has just 4 pages:
1. Home page
2. From the home page, he user can perform a search and land on the search page. 
3. On search page, if the user clicks on a product, he/she will get to the payment page, where she is asked to provide payment information in order to buy that product.
4. If she does decide to buy, she ends up on the confirmation page.

The company CEO isn't very happy with the volume of sales and, especially, of sales coming from new users. Therefore, she asked you to investigate whether there is something wrong in the conversion funnel or, in general, if I could suggest how conversion rate can be improved.
